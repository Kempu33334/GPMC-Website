His greatest achievements are clearing 32 Heat in Hades and Hades II, getting a full combo on Teo Master in Project Sekai, and being the dumbest National Stage qualifier in Philippine Math Olympiad history. He is best known for writing several high quality contests on MathDash. In his spare time, he enjoys playing rhythm games, tennis, bouldering, solving non-geometry problems, and engaging in orzwars.

                    <p style="text-align: left;">NamelyOrange is a norz failure residing in dark depths of the universe, aka your basement. While not being heckled by Inferno2332 on Discord, he enjoys procrastinating on his ten overdue assignments, coordbashing an AMC8 problem for three hours, feeling incompetent because of his achievement to age ratio, and constructing excessively long sentences. He also enjoys making cringe self-aware jokes. Like this.
